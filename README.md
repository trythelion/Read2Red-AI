## Read2Red AI API

**This is a POC Desktop Client for TTS improvement without dealing with HD voice training.**
Basic voices are unable to tell the difference between words like read and it's past tence version as they are spelled the same. The API will use AI to replace all instances of the base word with a modified spelling that only the TTS application will see.
The User of the TTS application in question will only see what the TTS app is suposed to read and not what it has gotten under the hood. This makes cheaper and/or free TTS apps more humanlike than robotic.

# THIS IS MADE FOR TESTING THE MODEL AND DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES NOT A FULL FLEDGED APPLICATION
